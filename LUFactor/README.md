# LU Factor Algorithm
This algorithm preforms a complete LU decomposition of an inputed matrix using Gauss Elimination. It asks for one matrix as an input. It then outputs upper (U), lower (l), and the pivot (P) matracies. One main limitation of this algorithm is division by zero, which is corrected by pivoting.
